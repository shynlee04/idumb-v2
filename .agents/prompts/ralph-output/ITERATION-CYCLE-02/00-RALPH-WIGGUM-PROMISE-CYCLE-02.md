## Observations -> That needs to be resolved, with complete and clear evidences of thorough understanding by using skills, mcp servers, doing as much context grabing to form a decent phase-base actionplan - Formming list of requiirements, acceptance criteria, describing clearn and complet user's use cases interacting of all components, concepts at any given point:

- 

### Non-negotiables:

## 3 Make atomic meaningful git commit (per task completion) distiguish between level of artifacts, changes of code files >>> MAKE UPDATE OF FILETREE AT EVERYTIME AT 
AGENTS.md
 

## 4 Tests passed >>> incremental tests passed >>> incremental integration no thing left unchecked, no logics make nonsensical here. This is schema-driven, types strict, cleaned architecture. non-debt non-gap development

## Promises of the loops: 

    - I **PROMISE** that I will never pass any gatekeeping as for I must check each and everything granularly, incrementally, across all dimensions both depth and width - I will not pass even 1% has not fulfill
- 
1. When it comes to data schema and types all the hierarchy, relationships, properties and contracts must all be mapped and diagnose so that no thing is missed and they are as SOT and to critic how broken, shallow and superficial this project is  
2. When it comes to this framework as a wrappers or as a stand-a-lone skeptically and extreme on the shallow how-to, the inconsistency, gaps, and inferiority  or as for drift and debt - make sure all the list check when accessing the how , the what and the possibility of this framework as a work a alone vs:
    1. Any spec-driven framework like Speck-kit
    2. GSD
    3. Agent-OS
3. check thoroughly anything related to types, schema, automation, hooks, loops and cycles of intelligent delegation. → for any misconceptions, conflicts, not integrated, not proven working in the industry, fantasy thought thought 
- I **PROMISE** That I understand all about the following events
