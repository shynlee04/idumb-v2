name: Backend Queries
description: Write efficient, secure database queries that prevent SQL injection, avoid N+1 problems, and optimize performance through proper indexing and caching strategies. Use this skill when writing SQL queries for PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, or any SQL database; when using ORM query builders like Prisma, Sequelize, TypeORM, ActiveRecord, Django ORM; when implementing parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection; when optimizing query performance with proper indexing; when eager loading relationships to avoid N+1 queries; when selecting specific columns instead of SELECT *; when wrapping related operations in transactions for data consistency; when implementing query timeouts to prevent runaway operations; when caching expensive query results; or when working with database query optimization and performance tuning.

# Backend Queries

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle backend queries.

## When to use this skill

- When writing SQL queries or using ORM query builders
- When preventing SQL injection with parameterized queries
- When optimizing queries to avoid N+1 problems
- When selecting specific columns for better performance
- When indexing columns used in WHERE, JOIN, and ORDER BY clauses
- When wrapping related database operations in transactions
- When implementing query timeouts and performance safeguards
- When caching expensive or frequently-run query results
- When working with PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, ORMs, or database query optimization
