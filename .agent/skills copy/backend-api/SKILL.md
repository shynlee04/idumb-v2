name: Backend API
description: Design, implement, and maintain RESTful API endpoints following industry best practices for resource-based URLs, HTTP methods, versioning, query parameters, and status codes. Use this skill when creating API routes in Express, Fastify, Next.js API routes, TanStack Router API endpoints, or any backend API framework; when defining RESTful resources with GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE operations; when implementing API versioning strategies; when adding query parameters for filtering, sorting, pagination, or search; when determining appropriate HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 404, 500, etc.); when structuring nested resources and endpoint naming conventions; when implementing rate limiting headers; or when working with API contract design and backend routing in TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, or any server-side language.

# Backend API

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle backend API.

## When to use this skill

- When creating RESTful API endpoints with resource-based URLs
- When defining HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) for API routes
- When implementing API versioning strategies (URL path or headers)
- When adding query parameters for filtering, sorting, pagination, or search
- When determining appropriate HTTP status codes for responses
- When structuring nested resources and endpoint URLs
- When implementing rate limiting headers and response metadata
- When working with API frameworks like Express, Fastify, Next.js API routes, TanStack Router, or similar
