name: Global Error Handling
description: Implement robust error handling with user-friendly messages, specific exception types, centralized error boundaries, graceful degradation, retry strategies, and proper resource cleanup. Use this skill when handling errors in backend or frontend code; when providing clear, actionable error messages to users; when validating input and failing fast with explicit error messages; when using specific exception types instead of generic errors; when implementing centralized error handling at appropriate boundaries; when designing systems to degrade gracefully when services fail; when implementing retry strategies with exponential backoff for external service calls; when cleaning up resources in finally blocks or equivalent mechanisms; when handling errors in React components with error boundaries; when logging errors for debugging and monitoring; or when structuring error handling across the application architecture.

# Global Error Handling

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle global error handling.

## When to use this skill

- When providing clear, actionable error messages to users without exposing technical details
- When validating input and failing fast with explicit error messages
- When using specific exception types instead of generic errors
- When implementing centralized error handling at appropriate boundaries
- When designing systems to degrade gracefully when services fail
- When implementing retry strategies with exponential backoff for external services
- When cleaning up resources in finally blocks or equivalent mechanisms
- When handling errors in React components with error boundaries
- When logging errors for debugging and monitoring descriptions
