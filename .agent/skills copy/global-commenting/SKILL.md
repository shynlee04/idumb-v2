name: Global Commenting
description: Write self-documenting code with minimal, evergreen comments that explain complex logic rather than obvious implementations or recent changes. Use this skill when writing code in any programming language; when deciding whether to add comments to explain logic; when writing comments that clarify complex algorithms or non-obvious reasoning; when documenting large sections of code; when avoiding comments that speak to recent or temporary changes or fixes; when prioritizing self-documenting code through clear structure and naming; when writing JSDoc, TSDoc, Python docstrings, or similar documentation comments; when refactoring code to be more self-explanatory; or when maintaining comment quality across the codebase.
