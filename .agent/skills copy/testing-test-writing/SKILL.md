name: Testing Test Writing
description: Write minimal, strategic tests for core user flows and critical paths while avoiding premature testing of edge cases or non-critical utilities. Use this skill when writing tests for critical business logic and primary user workflows; when deciding what to test during feature development; when testing behavior rather than implementation details; when writing descriptive test names that explain expected outcomes; when mocking external dependencies like databases, APIs, and file systems; when keeping unit tests fast (milliseconds) for frequent execution; when deferring edge case and error state testing unless business-critical; when focusing on core user flows rather than secondary workflows; when testing at logical completion points rather than every intermediate step; or when establishing test coverage strategies that balance development speed with quality assurance.

# Testing Test Writing

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle testing test writing.

## When to use this skill

- When writing minimal tests during development (not every change or intermediate step)
- When testing only core user flows and critical business paths
- When deferring edge case testing unless business-critical
- When testing behavior rather than implementation details
- When writing descriptive test names that explain expected outcomes
- When mocking external dependencies (databases, APIs, file systems)
- When keeping unit tests fast (milliseconds) for frequent developer execution
- When deciding what level of testing is required for feature completion
- When establishing test coverage strategies for the project
