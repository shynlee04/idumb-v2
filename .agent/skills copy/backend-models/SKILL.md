name: Backend Models
description: Design database models with clear naming conventions, appropriate data types, relationships, constraints, and indexing strategies. Use this skill when defining database models, schemas, or entities in ORMs like Prisma, Sequelize, TypeORM, ActiveRecord, Django ORM, Mongoose, or similar; when creating tables with PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB, or any database; when establishing model relationships (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many); when adding database constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, foreign keys); when implementing timestamps for auditing and debugging; when choosing appropriate data types for columns; when creating indexes on foreign keys and frequently queried fields; when balancing normalization with query performance; when implementing validation at model and database layers; or when structuring data models for optimal query performance and data integrity.
