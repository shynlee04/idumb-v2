name: Frontend Components
description: Build reusable, composable UI components with clear interfaces, proper state management, and single-responsibility design principles. Use this skill when creating React components, Vue components, Svelte components, or any UI framework components; when designing component APIs with props and sensible defaults; when implementing component composition patterns; when managing component state (local vs. lifted state); when writing component documentation and usage examples; when ensuring components are reusable across different contexts; when following single responsibility and encapsulation principles; when creating UI libraries or design systems; when optimizing component performance with proper rendering patterns; when building complex UIs by combining smaller components; or when structuring component architecture for scalability and maintainability.
