name: Global Validation
description: Implement robust input validation with server-side checks, client-side UX feedback, specific error messages, allowlist strategies, and consistent validation across all entry points. Use this skill when validating user input in web forms, API endpoints, or background jobs; when implementing server-side validation for security and data integrity; when adding client-side validation for immediate user feedback; when validating data types, formats, ranges, and required fields; when providing clear, field-specific error messages; when implementing allowlist strategies instead of blocklists; when sanitizing user input to prevent injection attacks (SQL, XSS, command injection); when validating business rules at the appropriate application layer; when applying validation consistently across web forms, API endpoints, and background jobs; or when designing validation architecture for security and user experience.

# Global Validation

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle global validation.

## When to use this skill

- When validating on the server side for security and data integrity
- When using client-side validation to provide immediate user feedback
- When validating input early and rejecting invalid data before processing
- When providing clear, field-specific error messages
- When implementing allowlist strategies instead of blocklists
- When checking data types, formats, ranges, and required fields
- When sanitizing user input to prevent injection attacks
- When validating business rules at the appropriate application layer
- When applying validation consistently across all entry points
