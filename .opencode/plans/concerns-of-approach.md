## Before this can be meticulously developed → I need these adjustment for atomic actions + most frequent mechanism → stress test to pass

Though the plan has clearly shows the overview of “how-to” → and from each of the point if succeed can expand horizontally → however it lacks micro phases to decisions of pivoting in the tactical spectacle → for instance if  after each of my message at any point of the conversation with the agents or phases of the development and base on the mechanism of interception hook that appends a message to let the main agent start calling the sub for context purification and start new. The action if either breaks the OpenCode TUI → it willl try the workaround → if the workaround does not result the expected action → as for never happen the purified context call or if happens but the context purification does not help with what I think as a strategy to help with “intelligence” and “awareness” as a concept → then also pivot to another

→ so what I meant here is, clearly understand what concepts I use → to reflect to plugins’ hooks and interception or executions of tools  to design more of the micro milestones (taking what most likely with  high frequency first)
