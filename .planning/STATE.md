## Recent Decisions

| Decision | When | Phase |
|----------|------|-------|
| Project pivoted from graph visualization to full knowledge-work platform | 2026-02-09 | Pre-Phase 1 |
| Start fresh — branch and aggressively clean existing codebase | 2026-02-09 | Pre-Phase 1 |
| OpenCode as engine (SDK + Server), not custom LLM backend | 2026-02-09 | Pre-Phase 1 |
| JSON files for state, not graph database — sufficient at ~1000 node scale | 2026-02-09 | Pre-Phase 1 |
| 4-phase roadmap: Engine → Governance → Knowledge → UI | 2026-02-09 | Pre-Phase 1 |
